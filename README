Sql::Simple - yet another SQL abstraction layer

Version: 0.04

WHAT IS IT

The Sql::Simple package is a fairly easy way to generate SQL
statements and execute them.  The structures can represent 
single statement execution, or mass execution of a single statement.

USING Sql::Simple

This is a simple utility module that rides on top of the DBI/DBD
architecture.  An instantiated database handle is expected as an
argument to any of the functions.  Here's an example

use strict;
use DBI;
use Sql::Simple;

my $dbh = DBI->connect('dbi:DBTYPE:INSTANCE', 'username', 'password');
Sql::Simple->insert($dbh, [ qw(column1 column2) ], 'randomtable' [ qw(value1 value2) ]);

KNOWN LIMITATIONS

As this is designed as a generic abstraction layer, anything you attempt to do in
this module that is not possible under the database you have chosen will continue to
not work.  (Subqueries on mysql 3.X for example)

BUILDING/INSTALLING

This package is set up to configure and build like a typical perl extension.
To build:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make && make test

If Sql::Simple passes all tests, then:

  make install

You mae require super-user access to install.
